A software synthesizer written as a part of my engineer's thesis, using only Java SE libraries.
It consists of the following modules:
* two oscillators with four standard waveforms,
* amplitude envelope,
* delay effect,
* reverb effect,
* output volume setting,
* buffer size setting.

More details about each of the modules:
* oscillators - for each of the oscillators choose a waveform from sine, triangle, sawtooth and square; setup the pitch shift in semitones and cents; finally adjust the balance between the two oscillators,
* amplitude envelope - standard ADSR envelope,
* delay effect - simple feedback delay with *dry/wet* balance and *feedback* amount settings,
* reverb effect - Schrodinger inspired reverb with *dry/wet* balance and *decay* factor settings,
* buffer size settings - choose the size of the buffer generated by each of the oscillators (256 - 512 - 1024 - 2048).
